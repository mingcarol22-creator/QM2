Let's examine the data and start to see what we can say about it. First of all, we have to find data - I'm interested in looking in data with a wide spread, so I looked for data on income in the UK.\n",

        "I ended up using data from 2011, generated from a study called the Family Resources Survey and collated and tweaked by an independent research unit called the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS). The \"tweaking\" they do tends to be around the size of the family unit, and other factors which create economies of scale - hence they \"equivalise\" it. The IFS is quoted in UK Government documents, so we can have some trust in their impartiality, or at least accuracy - of course, if we were publishing research about this, that's not really good enough and we'd want to reproduce, or at least understand and critique, their methodology rather than just trusting it!\n",
